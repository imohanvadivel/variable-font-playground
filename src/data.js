Excerpt From: Carl Sagan. “Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space”. <br /> <br />
Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, ever king and peasant, every young couple in love, every moth and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar,” every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there—on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam. <br /><br />
The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. <br /><br />
Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves. <br /><br />
The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand. <br /><br />
It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.`;

I am sure in some years from now you will see new posters with just
white space and four lines in Garamond.

Le point avec le type est que vous ne soyez pas conscient qu'il est
là. Si vous vous souvenez de la forme d'une cuillère avec laquelle
vous venez de manger de la soupe, la cuillère avait une mauvaise
forme.

Typography must often draw attention to itself before it will be
read. Yet in order to be read, it must relinquish the attention it
has drawn.

Si vous vous souvenez de la forme de votre cuillère au déjeuner,
elle doit être de la mauvaise forme. La cuillère et la lettre sont
des outils; l'un pour prendre de la nourriture dans le bol, l'autre
pour retirer des informations de la page ... Quand c'est un bon
design, le lecteur doit se sentir à l'aise car la lettre est à la
fois banale et belle.
